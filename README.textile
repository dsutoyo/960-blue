h2. Info

Thank you for downloading 960-Blue, a mashup of the 960 Grid System and the Blueprint CSS Framework. The mashup was originally created to help with my own workflow. I loved the simplicity of 960, but wanted more padding and spacing in the grid. I also really liked how Blueprint sets up basic styles that are useful as a starting point. Add to that Containers, a small plugin I wrote for 960, which adds some extra classes to the system to help with nesting grid units -- specifically in instances where the developer is unable to add the "alpha" and "omega" classes. The result was a CSS framework mashup that suited my own needs.

h2. Customizable

Included with 960-Blue are SASS files for use with SASS and Compass to generate custom grid frameworks for needs specific to a project. The syntax is based on SASS 3 and is not compatible with previous versions of SASS. For more info, please see:
